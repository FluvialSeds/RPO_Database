About the RPO Database
======================
The Ramped-temperature Pyrolysis/Oxidation (RPO) database contains all published RPO raw data, including both thermograms and isotope (:sup:`13`\ C and :sup:`14`\ C) results, where available. All samples are described in the `sample_metadata.csv` file, and all results are presented in the `thermogram` and `isotope` sub-folders. Results are presented as `.csv` files in NOSAMS RPO lab-view format.
